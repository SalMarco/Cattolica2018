# Empirical Research Python Lab

## Prerequisites

The course will be focused on an introduction to Python with focus to data analysis and machine learning.

The two main tolls will be:
  - **Jupyter:** interactive notebook for Python and others language
  - **Git:** repository system [wiki page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git)

### Install git

  - **For Window user:** download git from https://gitforwindows.org/. During the installation select **use git bash only** in the relative step, leave the rest like it is.
  - **For Unix/Mac users:** git should be already available in the terminal.

I invite you to create and account on [GitHub](https://github.com/) or [GitLab](https://gitlab.com/users/sign_in) and start to using it following some guide like:
  - http://kbroman.org/github_tutorial/pages/init.html
  - http://rogerdudler.github.io/git-guide/

### Install Anaconda

One the easiest way to have Python and Jupyter is via Anaconda.

From the site download the version for **Python 3.6**:

https://www.anaconda.com/download/

You can find a guide for Jupyter here: [Jupyter Guide](https://www.datacamp.com/community/tutorials/tutorial-jupyter-notebook).

### Add R Kernel to Jupyter (Optional)

If you want try to use R in Jupyter follow the instruction in the following link.

**NOTE** Sometimes for some Windows users can be difficult. If you run in some problems try the following:

https://stackoverflow.com/questions/44056164/jupyter-client-has-to-be-installed-but-jupyter-kernelspec-version-exited-wit

In any case it is not mandatory for the course and we can address any problems later.
